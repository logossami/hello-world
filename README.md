My Hello World repo just to finally get started.

Hi there! I am on my way to hopefully becoming a developer and security professional at an old age. But it's never too late, they say.

I've spent time learning the basics of programming in JavaScript, Python and Java. Getting familiar with the Linux shell as well, Mint is currently my distro of choice but moving into Kali later.

Hoping to become a pentester some day soon. Learning common tools such as Burp Suite, Nmap and Metasploit, hopping between scripts, C and Assembly code and physical registries in my learning path. 

Absorbing Youtube videos and purchased VIP membership for an excellent security course package, including preps for certifications and exams.

Been into blockchain since 2017, especially Ethereum. Haven't written any proper smart contracts yet as my coding skills suck, but I know pretty well what's happening in the community as it's also been my doctoral dissertation topic.

Learning cybersecurity has never been more exciting!
